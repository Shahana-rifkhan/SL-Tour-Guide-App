## Main Features

### Online Capability

- **Firebase Integration**: SL Tour Guide relies on Firebase to dynamically display up-to-date information about various travel packages. These packages, filled with details about activities and locations, are accessible only with an active internet connection.

### Offline Capability

- **SQLite Embedded Database**: The app employs an SQLite embedded database to ensure uninterrupted access to essential features, even when offline. Users can explore and manage other app functionalities without needing an internet connection.

### Contact Us in Packages

- **Direct Communication**: A key feature of SL Tour Guide is the ability to contact package operators directly. Within the Packages section, users can click on a "Contact Us" option, which provides the choice to make a direct phone call or send a text message, simplifying communication.

### Favorites

- **Personalized Experience**: Users can mark their favorite tourist attractions from the home screen, which are then stored in a dedicated "Favorites" section. This feature makes it easy to organize and revisit preferred locations.

### Feedback

- **User Feedback**: A dedicated Feedback screen allows users to share their thoughts, suggestions, or concerns. This feature, located in the left-hand corner of the menu bar, encourages open communication with the development team. Feedback can be deleted or updated within 10 seconds, as it will only last in the UI for 10 seconds.

### FAQ and Privacy Features

- **Comprehensive Information**: The side menu includes sections for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Privacy. These sections provide users with detailed information about the app's operations, privacy policies, and common queries.

### Social Sharing Integration

- **Share Packages**: Users can share their favorite travel packages with friends through social sharing integration. This feature promotes easy communication and collaborative planning by allowing users to send desired packages to others in their network.
